> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Winpercent is the only one that isn’t on a 0-1 one scale.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

One means that it is true that the candy does contain chocolate, a zero
means it does not.

## Exploratory Analysis

``` r
#Load ggplot
library(ggplot2)
```

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values using both base R and
> ggplot2.

``` r
#Default R histogram
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

``` r
#ggplot histogram
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent)+
  geom_histogram()
```

    `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png)

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution of winpercent values are not symmetrical.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

It is below 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

On average chocolate is higher ranked than fruit candy.

``` r
fruitywin <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
chocowin <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])

fruitywin > chocowin
```

    [1] FALSE

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

Yes, this difference is statistically significant.

``` r
t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)], candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] and candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0

## Exploring the correlation structure

``` r
library(corrplot)
```

    corrplot 0.95 loaded

``` r
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
> (i.e. have minus values)?

From the corrplot, it seems the two variables that are the most
anti-correlated are chocolate and fruity.

> Q23. Use your corrplot result to make a prediction: which variables do
> you expect will have the largest contributions (i.e. loadings) to PC1
> (i.e., drive the most separation between candies along the first
> principal component)?

The three variables picked up strongly in the positive direction are
fruity, pluribus, and hard. This does make sense as the three were
slightly unique in the way that they had a negative correlation with
most everything else, but positive with each other.

A winning candy is a chocolate bar with peanuts with an okay price
point. Exploratory analysis helps with identifying that chocolate was
statistically significant. Correlation analysis shows which traits
cluster together. Then PCA gives us the structure and confirms what is
driving the variance. It helps explain the previous two.
